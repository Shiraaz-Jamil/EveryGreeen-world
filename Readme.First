This project is all about Genrating electricity and making it a primary source of electricity, so that Nuclear Reactor can have Rest
My aim is to make the genrator capable of genrating a 180v-240v AC. But it also need to silent and less harmful to enviornment.
There are Two magnators One that genrates Main Supply and the other rotates the First Magnetor
I am thinking to use mercury (In liquid state) and use two powerful permanent magnets, the mercury will create a vortex and help in rotaing the shaft so that there is no loss of electricity.
the major problem is the circuit design that what type of circuit can help in amplifying the electricity.
I though of using a step-up transformer and two 25000uF capacitor with 1.5k Resistior.
I also create a Vaccum in the chamber so no noise can be heared from outside of the chamber. But I want to secure my genrator with the problem it might get while genrating electricity..
